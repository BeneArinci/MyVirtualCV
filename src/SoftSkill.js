          I’m an active learner, I like to explore new technologies and apply what I learn in my
          projects. I try to look at solutions from different points of view so as to take a thought out decision. 
          When I am in front of a challenge, I won't stop until I solve it. 
          During the Coding Bootcamp I sharpened this specific skill applying it to software development and I demonstrated that I can do anything :)

         Clear communication is a key element in any collaborative environment. 
         For this reason, I try to be as clear as possible when I explain my ideas and I tend to ask questions and start a meaningful conversation when I feel that what I am working on is not clear enough to me. 
         I am also an active listener and I do care of other people's opinion.
         At Makers, I have learnt a lot about EQ/Emotional Intelligence and this helped me improve my ability to give and receive meaningful feedback.

          I like to contribute to having a happy team and a respectful working environment. I
          regularly ask for feedback from my peers so to improve in my behaviours and day to
          day job and I always do my best to help identify ways to improve the team’s ways of
          working

        I am always keen to understand my stakeholders' needs and to find the best solutions to satisfy them. 
        As a recruiter, I had the opportunity to work both with external (clients) and internal (hiring managers) stakeholders. 
        The key to success is listening and ask for the right questions. I'll always bring this knowledge with me
