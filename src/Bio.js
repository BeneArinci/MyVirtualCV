      I am an ordinary woman with an extraordinary passion for people. Always eager to learn and intrigued by finding the best solution to problems.
Since I moved to London, 4 years ago, I have been working as a recruiter. I built my career from scratch, starting from zero experience and a basic level of English. I am so proud of it that I wanted to do it again ðŸ’ª
Why tech? In any other job, sooner or later, you'll stop learning. In tech, you are always able to keep on growing as much as you wish.
From what I have experienced so far, when I am coding I always feel outside my comfort zone. The more I learn, the more I feel like I need to learn more. Finding a solution to a problem pushes me to look for new and more challenging ones to solve. This a really exciting feeling.
I was able to get into Makers, one of the best software development bootcamps in Europe, accepting only 10% of applicants. I learnt so much during the last 4-5 months. I am now ready (and excited) to start my career as a software developer. The idea of working with a super team providing tech solution to real-life challenges thrills me ðŸ’— 
Along with my recently built tech skills, I bring with me a solid set of soft skills that I built during my past working experience and studies that are really valuable when it comes to work with other people and I am looking forward to making use of all of them. Stronger together is my motto! ðŸ™Œ
