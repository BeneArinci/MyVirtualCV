    description: "I’m an active learner, I like to explore new technologies and apply what I learn in my projects. I try to look at solutions from different points of view so as to take a thought out decision. When I am in front of a challenge, I won't stop until I solve it. During the Coding Bootcamp I sharpened this specific skill applying it to software development and I demonstrated that I can do anything :)"

    title: "Communication & Listening",
    description: "Clear communication is a key element in any collaborative environment. For this reason, I try to be as clear as possible when I explain my ideas and I tend to ask questions and start a meaningful conversation when I feel that what I am working on is not clear enough to me. I am also an active listener and I do care of other people's opinion. At Makers, I have learnt a lot about EQ/Emotional Intelligence and this helped me improve my ability to give and receive meaningful feedback "

I'll always bring this knowledge with me"
